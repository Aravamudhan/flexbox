    <!-- flex property is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
    flex-grow - when there is extra space, how to divide the space among every item. If an item has 2,
    that means, that item should get twice as much space from the extra space as other items.
    default flex-grow:0 - do not take up any extra space.

    flex-shrink - When there is no extra space, this property says how items should divide up the available space
    This is opposite of flex-grow. Meaning, that any value would mean how much lesser space should an item
    take compared to other items. flex-grow:2 is twice as much flex-shrink:2 twice as little
    default flex-shrink:1 when there is less space, you should reduce yourselves as much as other items do

    flex-basis - Whenever there is no extra space this property kicks in.  Not just that, before an item grows or shrinks, 
    this property sets its size. By default it is auto-->
