    <!-- flex-basis flex-grow and flex-shrink only work on the row that they are applied. 
    The browser calculates width,height etc only for the item to which the properties are applied
    with respect to the row that item is present. When flex-grow is applied to a container, the actual
    flex-basis value/size is applied to items and the items will wrap to the next row if the size 
    overflows. Now if the flex property is applied to the items in the next row, those properties
    will be applied only to the items in that row. It wont't spill over to top or bottom -->
